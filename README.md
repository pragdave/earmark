# Earmark—A Pure Elixir Markdown Processor

<!-- moduledoc: Earmark -->

## Dependency

    { :earmark, "> x.y.z" }

## Usage

### API

      case Earmark.as_html(markdown) do
        {:ok, html_doc} -> ...
        {:error, html_doc, error_messages} -> ...
      end

Options can be passed into `as_html` according to the documentation.

      html_doc = Earmark.as_html!(markdown)

      html_doc = Earmark.as_html!(markdown, options)

Prints the error_messages returned by `as_html` to stderr and just returns the second element
of the tuple it had returned.

(Again, see the documentation for `as_html` for options)

### Command line

    $ mix escript.build
    $ ./earmark file.md

Some options defined in the `Earmark.Options` struct can be specified as command line switches.

Use
    $ ./earmark --help

to find out more, but here is a short example

    $ ./earmark --smartypants false --code-class-prefix "a- b-" file.md

will call

    Earmark.as_html!( ..., %Earmark.Options{smartypants: false, code_class_prefix: "a- b-"})


## Supports

Standard [Gruber markdown][gruber].

[gruber]: <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>

## Extensions

### Tables

Github Flavored Markdown tables are supported

        State | Abbrev | Capital
        ----: | :----: | -------
        Texas | TX     | Austin
        Maine | ME     | Augusta

Tables may have leading and trailing vertical bars on each line

        | State | Abbrev | Capital |
        | ----: | :----: | ------- |
        | Texas | TX     | Austin  |
        | Maine | ME     | Augusta |

Tables need not have headers, in which case all column alignments
default to left.

        | Texas | TX     | Austin  |
        | Maine | ME     | Augusta |

Currently we assume there are always spaces around interior vertical
bars. It isn't clear what the expectation is.

### Adding HTML attributes with the IAL extension

HTML attributes can be added to any block-level element. We use
the Kramdown syntax: add the line `{:` _attrs_ `}` following the block.

_attrs_ can be one or more of:

* `.className`
* `#id`
* name=value, name="value", or name='value'


Malformed attributes are ignored and a warning is issued to stderr.

If you need to render IAL-like test verbatim escape it:

`{:alpha, 42}`

This of course is not necessary in code blocks or text lines
containing an IAL-like string, as in

`the returned tuple should be {:error, "I wish you hadn't done that"}`

For example:

        # Warning
        {: .red}

        Do not turn off the engine
        if you are at altitude.
        {: .boxed #warning spellcheck="true"}

## Limitations

* Nested block-level HTML is correctly handled only if each HTML
  tag appears on its own line. So

        <div>
        <div>
        hello
        </div>
        </div>

  will work. However. the following won't

        <div><div>
        hello
        </div></div>

* John Gruber's tests contain an ambiguity when it comes to
  lines that might be the start of a list inside paragraphs.

  One test says that

        This is the text
        * of a paragraph
        that I wrote

  is a single paragraph. The "*" is not significant. However, another
  test has

        *   A list item
            * an another

  and expects this to be a nested list. But, in reality, the second could just
  be the continuation of a paragraph.

  I've chosen always to use the second interpretation—a line that looks like
  a list item will always be a list item.

* Rendering of block and inline elements.

  Block or void HTML elements that are at the absolute beginning of a line end
  the preceeding paragraph.

  Thusly

        mypara
        <hr>

  Becomes

        <p>mypara</p>
        <hr>

  While

        mypara
         <hr>

  will be transformed into

        <p>mypara
         <hr></p>

## Integration

### Syntax Highlightning

All backquoted or fenced code blocks with a language string are rendered with the given
language as a _class_ attribute of the _code_ tag.

For example:

      ```elixir
         @tag :hello
      ```

will be rendered as

       <pre><code class="elixir">...

If you want to integrate with a syntax highlighter with different conventions you can add more classes by specifying prefixes that will be
put before the language string.

Prism.js for example needs a class `language-elixir`. In order to achieve that goal you can add `language-`
as a `code_class_prefix` to `Earmark.Options`.

In the following example we want more than one additional class, so we add more prefixes.

      Earmark.as_html!(..., %Earmark.Options{code_class_prefix: "lang- language-"})

which is rendering

       <pre><code class="elixir lang-elixiri language-elixir">...

As for all other options `code_class_prefix` can be passed into the `earmark` executable as follows:

      earmark --code-class-prefix "language- lang-" ...

## Security

  Please be aware that Markdown is not a secure format. It produces
  HTML from Markdown and HTML. It is your job to sanitize and or
  filter the output of `Markdown.html` if you cannot trust the input
  and are to serve the produced HTML on the Web.

# Details
<!-- doc: Earmark.as_html -->
Given a markdown document (as either a list of lines or
a string containing newlines), returns a tuple containing either
`{:ok, html_doc}`, or `{:error, html_doc, error_messages}`
Where `html_doc` is an HTML representation of the markdown document and
`error_messages` is a list of strings representing information concerning
the errors that occurred during parsing.

The options are a `%Earmark.Options{}` structure:

* `renderer`: ModuleName

  The module used to render the final document. Defaults to
  `Earmark.HtmlRenderer`

* `gfm`: boolean

  True by default. Turns on Github Flavored Markdown extensions

* `breaks`: boolean

  Only applicable if `gfm` is enabled. Makes all line breaks
  significant (so every line in the input is a new line in the
  output.

* `smartypants`: boolean

  Turns on smartypants processing, so quotes become curly, two
  or three hyphens become en and em dashes, and so on. True by
  default.

So, to format the document in `original` and disable smartypants,
you'd call

    alias Earmark.Options
    Earmark.as_html(original, %Options{smartypants: false})

<!-- enddoc: Earmark.as_html -->
