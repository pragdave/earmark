### API

Earmark now exposes a well-defined and stable Abstract Syntax Tree

#### Earmark.as_ast


WARNING: This is just a proxy towards `EarmarkParser.as_ast` and is deprecated, it will be removed in version 1.5!

Replace your calls to `Earmark.as_ast` with `EarmarkParser.as_ast` as soon as possible.

**N.B.** If all you use is `Earmark.as_ast` consider _only_ using `EarmarkParser`.


The function is described below and the other two API functions `as_html` and `as_html!` are now based upon
the structure of the result of `as_ast`.

    {:ok, ast, []}                   = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown)
    {:ok, ast, deprecation_messages} = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown)
    {:error, ast, error_messages}    = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown)

#### Earmark.as_html

    {:ok, html_doc, []}                   = Earmark.as_html(markdown)
    {:ok, html_doc, deprecation_messages} = Earmark.as_html(markdown)
    {:error, html_doc, error_messages}    = Earmark.as_html(markdown)

#### Earmark.as_html!

    html_doc = Earmark.as_html!(markdown, options)

Formats the error_messages returned by `as_html` and adds the filename to each.
Then prints them to stderr and just returns the html_doc

#### Options

Options can be passed into `as_ast/2`as well as `as_html/2` or `as_html!/2` according to the documentation.

    {status, html_doc, errors} = Earmark.as_html(markdown, options)
    html_doc = Earmark.as_html!(markdown, options)
    {status, ast, errors} = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown, options)

### Command line

    $ mix escript.build
    $ ./earmark file.md

Some options defined in the `Earmark.Options` struct can be specified as command line switches.

Use

    $ ./earmark --help

to find out more, but here is a short example

    $ ./earmark --smartypants false --code-class-prefix "a- b-" file.md

will call

    Earmark.as_html!( ..., %Earmark.Options{smartypants: false, code_class_prefix: "a- b-"})

## Supports

Standard [Gruber markdown][gruber].

[gruber]: <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>

## Extensions

### Github Flavored Markdown

GFM is supported by default, however as GFM is a moving target and all GFM extension do not make sense in a general context, Earmark does not support all of it, here is a list of what is supported:

#### Strike Through

    iex(1)> Earmark.as_html! ["~~hello~~"]
    "<p>\n  <del>\nhello  </del>\n</p>\n"

#### Syntax Highlighting

All backquoted or fenced code blocks with a language string are rendered with the given
language as a _class_ attribute of the _code_ tag.

For example:

    iex(2)> [
    ...(2)>    "```elixir",
    ...(2)>    " @tag :hello",
    ...(2)>    "```"
    ...(2)> ] |> Earmark.as_html!()
    "<pre><code class=\"elixir\"> @tag :hello</code></pre>\n"

will be rendered as shown in the doctest above.

If you want to integrate with a syntax highlighter with different conventions you can add more classes by specifying prefixes that will be
put before the language string.

Prism.js for example needs a class `language-elixir`. In order to achieve that goal you can add `language-`
as a `code_class_prefix` to `Earmark.Options`.

In the following example we want more than one additional class, so we add more prefixes.

    Earmark.as_html!(..., %Earmark.Options{code_class_prefix: "lang- language-"})

which is rendering

    <pre><code class="elixir lang-elixir language-elixir">...

As for all other options `code_class_prefix` can be passed into the `earmark` executable as follows:

    earmark --code-class-prefix "language- lang-" ...

#### Tables

Are supported as long as they are preceded by an empty line.

    State | Abbrev | Capital
    ----: | :----: | -------
    Texas | TX     | Austin
    Maine | ME     | Augusta

Tables may have leading and trailing vertical bars on each line

    | State | Abbrev | Capital |
    | ----: | :----: | ------- |
    | Texas | TX     | Austin  |
    | Maine | ME     | Augusta |

Tables need not have headers, in which case all column alignments
default to left.

    | Texas | TX     | Austin  |
    | Maine | ME     | Augusta |

Currently we assume there are always spaces around interior vertical unless
there are exterior bars.

However in order to be more GFM compatible the `gfm_tables: true` option
can be used to interpret only interior vertical bars as a table if a seperation
line is given, therefor

     Language|Rating
     --------|------
     Elixir  | awesome

is a table (iff `gfm_tables: true`) while

     Language|Rating
     Elixir  | awesome

never is.

#### HTML Blocks

HTML is not parsed recursively or detected in all conditons right now, though GFM compliance
is a goal.

But for now the following holds:

A HTML Block defined by a tag starting a line and the same tag starting a different line is parsed
as one HTML AST node, marked with %{verbatim: true}

E.g.

      iex(3)> lines = [ "<div><span>", "some</span><text>", "</div>more text" ]
      ...(3)> {:ok, ast, _} = EarmarkParser.as_ast(lines)
      {:ok, [{"div", [], ["<span>", "some</span><text>"], %{verbatim: true}}, "more text"], []}

And a line starting with an opening tag and ending with the corresponding closing tag is parsed in similar
fashion

      iex(4)> EarmarkParser.as_ast(["<span class=\"superspan\">spaniel</span>"])
      {:ok, [{"span", [{"class", "superspan"}], ["spaniel"], %{verbatim: true}}], []}

What is HTML?

We differ from strict GFM by allowing **all** tags not only HTML5 tagsn this holds for oneliners....

      iex(5)> {:ok, ast, []} = EarmarkParser.as_ast(["<stupid />", "<not>better</not>"])
      ...(5)> ast
      [
        {"stupid", [], [], %{verbatim: true}},
        {"not", [], ["better"], %{verbatim: true}}]

and for multiline blocks

      iex(6)> {:ok, ast, []} = EarmarkParser.as_ast([ "<hello>", "world", "</hello>"])
      ...(6)> ast
      [{"hello", [], ["world"], %{verbatim: true}}]

#### HTML Comments

Are recoginized if they start a line (after ws and are parsed until the next `-->` is found
all text after the next '-->' is ignored

E.g.

    iex(7)> EarmarkParser.as_ast(" <!-- Comment\ncomment line\ncomment --> text -->\nafter")
    {:ok, [{:comment, [], [" Comment", "comment line", "comment "], %{comment: true}}, {"p", [], ["after"], %{}}], []}



### Adding HTML attributes with the IAL extension

#### To block elements

HTML attributes can be added to any block-level element. We use
the Kramdown syntax: add the line `{:` _attrs_ `}` following the block.

_attrs_ can be one or more of:

  * `.className`
  * `#id`
  * name=value, name="value", or name='value'

For example:

    # Warning
    {: .red}

    Do not turn off the engine
    if you are at altitude.
    {: .boxed #warning spellcheck="true"}

#### To links or images

It is possible to add IAL attributes to generated links or images in the following
format.

    iex(8)> markdown = "[link](url) {: .classy}"
    ...(8)> Earmark.as_html(markdown)
    { :ok, "<p>\n<a class=\"classy\" href=\"url\">link</a></p>\n", []}

For both cases, malformed attributes are ignored and warnings are issued.

    iex(9)> [ "Some text", "{:hello}" ] |> Enum.join("\n") |> Earmark.as_html()
    {:error, "<p>\nSome text</p>\n", [{:warning, 2,"Illegal attributes [\"hello\"] ignored in IAL"}]}

It is possible to escape the IAL in both forms if necessary

    iex(10)> markdown = "[link](url)\\{: .classy}"
    ...(10)> Earmark.as_html(markdown)
    {:ok, "<p>\n<a href=\"url\">link</a>{: .classy}</p>\n", []}

This of course is not necessary in code blocks or text lines
containing an IAL-like string, as in the following example

    iex(11)> markdown = "hello {:world}"
    ...(11)> Earmark.as_html!(markdown)
    "<p>\nhello {:world}</p>\n"

## Limitations

  * Block-level HTML is correctly handled only if each HTML
    tag appears on its own line. So

        <div>
        <div>
        hello
        </div>
        </div>

  will work. However. the following won't

        <div>
        hello</div>

* John Gruber's tests contain an ambiguity when it comes to
  lines that might be the start of a list inside paragraphs.

  One test says that

        This is the text
        * of a paragraph
        that I wrote

  is a single paragraph. The "*" is not significant. However, another
  test has

        *   A list item
            * an another

  and expects this to be a nested list. But, in reality, the second could just
  be the continuation of a paragraph.

  I've chosen always to use the second interpretation—a line that looks like
  a list item will always be a list item.

* Rendering of block and inline elements.

  Block or void HTML elements that are at the absolute beginning of a line end
  the preceding paragraph.

  Thusly

        mypara
        <hr />

  Becomes

        <p>mypara</p>
        <hr />

  While

        mypara
         <hr />

  will be transformed into

        <p>mypara
         <hr /></p>

## Timeouts

By default, that is if the `timeout` option is not set Earmark uses parallel mapping as implemented in `Earmark.pmap/2`,
which uses `Task.await` with its default timeout of 5000ms.

In rare cases that might not be enough.

By indicating a longer `timeout` option in milliseconds Earmark will use parallel mapping as implemented in `Earmark.pmap/3`,
which will pass `timeout` to `Task.await`.

In both cases one can override the mapper function with either the `mapper` option (used if and only if `timeout` is nil) or the
`mapper_with_timeout` function (used otherwise).

For the escript only the `timeout` command line argument can be used.

## Security

Please be aware that Markdown is not a secure format. It produces
HTML from Markdown and HTML. It is your job to sanitize and or
filter the output of `Earmark.as_html` if you cannot trust the input
and are to serve the produced HTML on the Web.

## Details

## `Earmark.as_ast/2`

<!-- BEGIN inserted functiondoc Earmark.as_ast/2 -->
`as_ast` is a compatibility function to call `EarmarkParser.as_ast`

It is deprecated and will be removed in 1.5! 

Options are passes like to `as_html`, some do not have an effect though (e.g. `smartypants`) as formatting and escaping is not done
for the AST.

      iex(12)> markdown = "```elixir\nIO.puts 42\n```"
      ...(12)> {:ok, ast, []} = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown, code_class_prefix: "lang-")
      ...(12)> ast
      [{"pre", [], [{"code", [{"class", "elixir lang-elixir"}], ["IO.puts 42"], %{}}], %{}}]


<!-- END inserted functiondoc Earmark.as_ast/2 -->

## `Earmark.as_html/2`

<!-- BEGIN inserted functiondoc Earmark.as_html/2 -->
Given a markdown document (as either a list of lines or
a string containing newlines), returns a tuple containing either
`{:ok, html_doc, error_messages}`, or `{:error, html_doc, error_messages}`
Where `html_doc` is an HTML representation of the markdown document and
`error_messages` is a list of tuples with the following elements

- `severity` e.g. `:error`, `:warning` or `:deprecation`
- line number in input where the error occurred
- description of the error


`options` can be an `%Earmark.Options{}` structure, or can be passed in as a `Keyword` argument (with legal keys for `%Earmark.Options`

* `renderer`: ModuleName

  The module used to render the final document. Defaults to
  `Earmark.HtmlRenderer`

* `gfm`: boolean

  True by default. Turns on the supported Github Flavored Markdown extensions

* `breaks`: boolean

  Only applicable if `gfm` is enabled. Makes all line breaks
  significant (so every line in the input is a new line in the
  output.

* `code_class_prefix`: binary

  Code blocks will be rendered with prefixed class names, which might be necessary for
  usage with 3rd party libraries.


        Earmark.as_html("```elixir\nCode\n```", code_class_prefix: "my_prefix_")

        {:ok, "<pre><code class=\"elixir my_prefix_elixir\">Code\```</code></pre>\n", []}


* `smartypants`: boolean

  Turns on smartypants processing, so quotes become curly, two
  or three hyphens become en and em dashes, and so on. True by
  default.

  So, to format the document in `original` and disable smartypants,
  you'd call


        alias Earmark.Options
        Earmark.as_html(original, %Options{smartypants: false})


* `pure_links`: boolean

  Pure links of the form `~r{\bhttps?://\S+\b}` are rendered as links from now on.
  However, by setting the `pure_links` option to `false` this can be disabled and pre 1.4
  behavior can be used.

## `Earmark.Transform.transform/2`

<!-- BEGIN inserted functiondoc Earmark.Transform.transform/2 -->
  Needs update for 1.4.7
