## Contributing

Pull Requests are happily accepted.

Please be aware of one _caveat_ when correcting/improving `README.md`.

The `README.md` is generated by `Extractly` as mentioned above and therefore contributers shall not modify it directly, but
`README.md.eex` and the imported docs instead.

Thank you all who have already helped with Earmark, your names are duely noted in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
